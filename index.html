        <h4>The Perfect Getaway</h4>
        <p>
          Pech Guillou is often described as one of the most beautiful houses in the area,  it rests as one of the only traditional stone manoir house on top of a mountain in the middle .
          Because of its unique location, the medieval hunting lodge offers breathtaking views which have changed little over the centuries.

          The weather in the area is always very mild with very warm summers. From June till September the weather is comparable to the Provence.
          Of course the house has full central heating, so itâ€™s ideal for use outside the normal holiday season. While winter weather can never be guaranteed, the winters here are usually mild.
